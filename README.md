*by: Bran Odom, Donna Soto, Valery Rodriguez, Edris Vega*

## Mission
Blackout Buddy is a mobile-friendly website that aims to prepare users for hurricane-related disasters. With a goal of protection and risk mitigation, we strive to include all the necessary tools and tips for staying prepared in the wake of disaster. Blackout Buddy will serve as an all-in-one information hub, allowing the user to access many helpful resources to stay prepared.

## Problem
One of the main problems during an emergency is a lack of knowledge and preparedness. Blackout Buddy was developed to solve this problem and provide the tools and knowledge required to prepare for disaster.

## Features
### Water Calculator
Blackout Buddy's **Water Calculator** is a web-based tool that takes user input for the amount of days to prepare for, as well as the number of people in your household. This is used to calculate an average amount of gallons that you may need for a given period.
### Generators Page
Blackout Buddy features a **Generators** page that informs users of the proper ways to install and maintain a generator.
### Sandbags Page
Similar to the **Generators** page, our **Sandbags** page provides the user with helpful info about sandbag protection to ensure functionality and proper use.

## Goals
Blackout Buddy aims not only to provide helpful tips, but to be a tool for helping the user prepare. In the future, we hope to develop calculators for the amount of gas and sandbags needed to shelter in place. We aim to make the form results shareable via secure e-mail and downloadable via PDF. Optimizing our framework to become scalable is a priority for adding new features to Blackout Buddy.
